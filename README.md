Model Loader:

A multi-threaded model parser for .obj files.

Seven Sages:

A logical problem where 7 (or more if desired) wise men need to cycle through 3 states 3 times before ending their day. A wise man needs to think / meditate and eat. To eat, he needs both of the 2 chopsticks to his left and right that he shares with his neighbours. Thus, a wise man cannot eat if one of his neighbours is eating. In this case, should his meditation end before his neighbours finish eating, he will have to wait until both chopsticks are available. This assignment uses mainly mutexes to check if chopsticks are available.
